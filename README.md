2. Open VSCode
3. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
4. Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
5. Select the downloaded VSIX file

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Copy this entire folder to your VSCode extensions directory:
   - **macOS**: `~/.vscode/extensions/`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\`

2. Restart VSCode

## Activation

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`

## TV Static Effect (Optional)

To enable the authentic industrial monitor TV static effect:

### Prerequisites
Install the **Custom UI Style** extension:
1. Open VSCode Extensions (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`)

### TV Static Effect
When enabled, the subtle static animation provides an authentic industrial monitor experience without interfering with code readability.

## Compatibility

- VSCode 1.74.0+
- All major programming languages
- Light and dark variants (dark theme)

## Troubleshooting

### Theme Not Appearing
- Ensure the extension is properly installed

### Static Effect Issues
- Verify Custom UI Style extension is installed and enabled
- Check that CSS file path is correct
- Restart VSCode after making changes
- Reduce static opacity if effect is too strong

### Performance
The TV static effect is optimized for minimal performance impact:
- Uses CSS animations instead of JavaScript
- Very low opacity to maintain readability
- Lightweight gradient-based approach
